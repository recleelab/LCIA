# LCIA
The Live Cell Imaging Analysis (LCIA) package is a Python-based toolkit designed to streamline quantitative analysis of live-cell fluorescence microscopy experiments. Developed to support the research of the Lee Lab.  LCIA enables efficient extraction, segmentation, and correction of single-cell trajectories across large, complex imaging datasets.
